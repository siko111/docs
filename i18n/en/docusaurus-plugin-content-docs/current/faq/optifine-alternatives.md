# OptiFine Alternatives
OptiFine is an extremely unstable mod that has a huge number of incompatibility problems with other modifications.  
This page contains mods that can replace the functionality of OptiFine.

## Optimization {#optimization}
* Sodium ([Fabric/NeoForge](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium)) - the core rendering optimization level

    :::warning[The mod conflicts with Phosphor]
    :::
* FerriteCore ([Forge/Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core)) - memory usage optimization
* VulkanMod ([Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod)) - replaces the OpenGL renderer with an Vulkan implementation

    While this mod can greatly increase game performance, [it will break all mods](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/discussions/226) that use OpenGL directly

    * Vulkanite ([Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanite-mod)) - Iris addon which adds support for **hardware-accelerated raytracing** in Minecraft
        :::danger[Warning!]
        Vulkanite requires a graphics card with hardware raytracing support, such as NVIDIA RTX.  
        Also, this mod is **very early in development** and **is extremely unstable**.
        :::
* Canvas ([Fabric/Quilt](https://modrinth.com/mod/canvas)) - an alternative rendering engine for Minecraft with custom (non-OptiFine-compatible) shaders support
    :::info
    OptiFine shaders will not work with Canvas. Canvas states full compatibility with the Fabric API, but has many compatibility issues with other mods.
